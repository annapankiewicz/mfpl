# Information

I completed this project during FS17 while taking CS 3500 (Programming Languages and Translators) at Missouri S&T. I worked with [Anna Pankiewicz](https://github.com/annapankiewicz) for the static analysis portion (in the master branch), and I worked by myself to complete the dynamic analysis portion (in the hw06 branch).
